<h2>Basket Ball</h2>
<p>Basketball, colloquially referred to as hoops,[1] is a team sport in which two teams, 
    most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court,
     compete with the primary objective of<strong> shooting a basketball </strong>(approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter)
      through <strong> defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court)</strong>
       while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop</p>
